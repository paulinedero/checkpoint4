Develop a simple App front side and server side.
My app consists in a Baby Follow Up where you can enter your baby's data to track her/his development and get simple tricks to help you in your new life and organization.

## Techs

To run the App : 
1. Execute the Init.sql script to create the Database.
2. Execute the Insert.sql script to insert test data's.
3. Front-Side : Download the Expo Go App on your phone and execute the "Expo Start" command on your terminal. Scan the QR-Code.
4. Back-Side : Execute the npm start command on your terminal. 
Don't forget to place you in the right folders before executing commands and to adapt the .env file with your credentials.
